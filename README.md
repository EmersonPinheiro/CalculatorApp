# :iphone: CalculatorApp

A simple mobile calculator app, made using React Native, and it's based in the [Calculator App](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas/blob/master/Projects/1-Beginner/Calculator-App.md) from the App Ideas Project.

The functioning it's pretty simple, it makes simple math operations between two numbers, even float format. Even though it is a simple app, all math operations were coded not using pre-made functions.

The style was inspired by Neomorphism. The app's name (when installed) comes from it.
